*****************
Elementary School
*****************

**It all started** for me in the schoolyard. I decided I wanted to be an entymologist. This was because all of my friends were insects. The children I knew tended to bully me, and I preferred
to spend time observing the much more interesting, and rational, behaviour of "creepy crawlies". I loved my ant farm. I loved science, and I loved chess. I wasn't allowed to play with batteries -- they were too
dangerous in the eyes of my parents for a kid in grade 3 to experiment with, so I discovered Faraday's disk and magnetism. Faraday became my childhood hero.

What was most interesting about insects, and my ants in particular, was that they each individually seemed quite dim. Following one around on its own didn't convince me of any interesting intelligence therein. But
the contrast of that dimness with the excitement of watching my colony as a whole kept me fascinated -- literally for years. And this fascination has never truly dissapeared, only evolved to encompass more instances of
complexity.

My uncle Rhudy gave me a huge stack of index cards one day. It seemed to me that the stack must include every animal ever discovered, along with useful information such as their genus, family and species. Forgetting
about my obsesion with insects, I set out to arrange the index cards into a tree that was representative of the structure of the animals' memberships in the family, genus and species hierarchy. This covered the floor of
the main floor of my family's home.

I was still enjoying magnetism thoroughly. I conducted many experiments, trying to characterize the strengths of electromagnetic fields sustained by the various shapes of the magnetized objects. I thought I had a
breakthrough when I saw how the strenght of a coiled magnetized paperclip differed so much from a straightened one! Even better, the more coils and the closer together they were, the more strong the field seemed to be.
I thought it demonstrated that the EM field strength must be a function of the proximity of all the individual particles of the paperclip, to each other. Not exactly the most cleverly devised or interpreted experiemnt,
but I think I did pretty well for an 8 year old when I connected this idea of simple constituents creating a more complex cumulative effect to the similar observations I had made of my insects. I think I did alright when
I decided next that at some level of description everything in the world must be a simple process, a black box with an input and output, that contributed to the more complex systems around it. I became a strong believer in
reductionism before I finished elementary school.

I sat down on my bedroom floor and thought that it was about time I decided what I wanted to do with my life and who I wanted to be, towards the end of grade 6. I decided it was unlikely that I would want to work for
anyone since it would stifle creative thinking. I decided I would be an inventor, I would sell my inventions in order to make a living, and they would change the world for the better. I thought that the two main problems
in the world were the massive amoutn of energy used by computers, and the emissions of cars. My work on these problems started immediately, and I've been working on at least one of these problems ever since (Elon Musk may
have dealt with one of them before I managed to :) ). Since I thought everything around me was computing things all the time, I decided I wanted to go into physical computing and eventually rid the world of cars and electronics.

I did my grade 8 science fair poster presentation on quantum field theory. Got ranked dead last. No one understood a word I said.

High School
***********

**In highschool** I became obsessed with parabolic functions. Specifically, superimposing grids and circles onto parabolas in discrete steps. I became known by my math teachers as "the circle guy". I spent entire evenings trying
to work out on paper what kinds of things could be embedded into the simple recursive evaluation of a discretized parabolic function. **It seemed endless. I became truly, deeply obsessed.** I started solving all
of the math competition questions using geometrical ideas, and managed to solve some problems in very unorthodox, yet correct ways. The obsession with discretized geometry led to me to numerically evaluate and compare (by hand) the derivatives
of the angles in iteratively morphing triangular forms, before I was taught what a derivative was. I discovered how to solve integration questions by simply breaking the problem up into iterative steps, and evaluating the rate equations
with different (scaled) axes at each step, before I was taught integration. At the end of highschool, our AP math class had a goodbye dinner at which I bodly claimed there was nothing separating calculus and trigonometry conceptually.

Of course, when asked *why* I was obsessed by any of these things, I didn't say I really knew. I felt embarassed whenever I was asked why I was doing the things I did. I wasn't ready to share my plan to rid the world of electronics
using physics and math, so I sheepishly shrunk from the questions. People thought I was weird -- and rightly so. Still, I had started out with the idea that my work would be an independent endeavour. So, this didn't phase me too badly. My favourite
super hero was Green Lantern, who did everything by "sheer will power", and I took that example to heart.

I took a computer electronics course and electronics became the best thing in the world. After our first class, which only covered AND, OR and NOT gates, I turned to the classmate beside me and said "He's given us everything! We can build anything we
can imagine now!"

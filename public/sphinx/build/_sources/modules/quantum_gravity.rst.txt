=============================
How We Solved Quantum Gravity
=============================

Quantum gravity has been one of the most difficult problems for physicists, up until *very recently*
:cite:`WolframAnnouncement`. This is the story from my perspective of how this discovery was made and shared in 2019 and
2020 by several scientists (including myself), who were working independently of one another.

I am *thrilled* to see the work being validated and repeated by others like Dr. Wolfram who, admittedly, have done much
more extensive and impressive work than I. I'm *very excited* to see how the world will continue to expand on this work
in the collaborative and open framework being created by Wolfram Research in the coming years!

****************
My Goals in 2018
****************

I began my graduate studies in 2018 with very lofty goals and set out to do the following:

1.   Resolve the quantum mechanics interpretations
2.   Provide the missing piece for a true theory of consciousness
3.   Solve the AI control problem
4.   Provide a protocol for control
5.   Provide a strategy for bridging m-theory and our reality by introducing a higher conscious agent
6.   Justify quantum darwinism
7.   Justify the efficient simulation of quantum systems
8.   Design a graph characterization approach to identifying consciousness
9.   Develop a quantum algorithm for *fast* consciousness classification
10.  Thereby derive a functional quantum definition of consciousness
11.  Provide a technical roadmap for a *feasible* implementation of quantum conscious agents

I was strongly discouraged from trying to tackle all of this in a Masters degree. I eventually found myself switching \
into a PhD fast-track, but was still encouraged to leave the AI and consciousness related work "on the back-burner."

I settled at first with a quantum emulation project. The goal of this project was to *emulate* the behaviour of quantum
systems, specifically quantum harmonic oscillators, using commonplace electrical components. Still, this sub-project
combined control theory, machine learning, quantum mechanics, electrical engineering, software engineering,
and microchip design. It was enough to scare off almost every professor I spoke to at the university, and it looked like
I wasn't going to be able to put a committee together around it.

These are some of the things I heard as I pitched the project to the members of the Institute for Quantum Computing,
as well as the Physics and Engineering departments at the university:

.. code-block::

    "I don't think you should apply machine learning to everything."
    -- A researcher and professor of engineering

    "I can't read a single page of electrical engineering."
    -- A researcher and professor of quantum physics

    "I don't know enough about quantum mechanics."
    -- A researcher and professor of engineering

    "What you need is a mathematician."
    -- A researcher and professor of quantum physics

I was fortunate by this point to have a number of connections with inventors and entrepreneurs in the industry, who were
more open to some of my ideas. I pitched the initial emulation idea to a few industry mentors and past collaborators.

.. code-block::

    "If you think you can handle the broad interdisciplinary nature of it, go for it!"
    -- A seasoned serial entrepreneur

    "Be careful you don't give the ideas away. When you go into business, I would like to be a founder."
    -- A seasoned entrepreneur and inventor

Encouraged at least by some of the feedback from my friends in the industry, my supervisor and I decided the project was
worth looking into. I was absolutely pumped. The committee, we thought, would come later.

I started out by trying to combine two topics I loved: quantum information theory and analog control theory. I also had
the chance to satiate my obsession with logistic maps by building a recursively evaluated logistic map into the analog
circuitry. And so, I began in earnest in September 2018.

******************************
The Analog Electrical Emulator
******************************

Below I include writing from my work on the analog electrical emulator from 2018 - 2019, interspersed with retrospective
comments.

:past:`At the core of any quantum simulation or emulation is the idea of mapping quantum information to classical information.
At its simplest, we need each modellable quantum state to be mapped to some classical state of our classical simulation
device. Let` :math:`a \mathbb{\epsilon} \mathbb{Z}` :past:`be an integer variable. It will be the goal for this value to be
"observable", meaning that it can be measured or determined with minimal calculation and minimal deduction. This variable`
:math:`a` :past:`will be used to give each individual modellable quantum state an observable identification number.`

:past:`Consider a system with practical boundaries on the magnitude of its possible states. Let any state of the system in
question initially be assumed to be expressible using continuous variables, and modelleable by analog signals. We know
that a system matching this description is possible to engineer. As La Cour and Ott demonstrated experimentally in their
paper published in 2015` :cite:`Cour2015SignalbasedCE` :past:`, it is possible to implement a signal-based emulation of a universal qubit quantum computer.
However, they did not provide a scalable or practically useful scheme because of the evolution of the system's more complex
states in time. To produce 95 bits would require a calculation duration of roughly the age of the universe using their scheme.
So, let us assert that a viable solution must have a dependence on time that scales linearly with the complexity of the
operation. This will encourage improvement upon the design proposed by La Cour and Ott.`

:past:`Finally, a viable solution must not require the amount of hardware components or digital computing resources to scale
exponentially with the amount of modelled quantum information.`

I was inspired by a signal-based emulation that was demonstrated in 2015 :cite:`Cour2015SignalbasedCE`, which I had
`reviewed <https://mackedweise.github.io/qemu.pdf>`_ as a class project in undergrad.

|

:past:`In 2015, La Cour and Ott` :cite:`Cour2015SignalbasedCE` :past:`described an implementation scheme for a signal
based emulation of general quantum computing. This model was demonstrated using analog electronics. Their scheme
introduced a mapping from quantum states to electrical analog phase representations.`

:past:`The model starts with representing the quantum state` :math:`|0>` :past:`by the in-phase and quadrature
components of an analog electrical signal. The` :math:`|0>` :past:`state is defined as` :math:`s(t)`:

|

.. math::

    s(t) = a \cdot cos(\omega_ct) - b \cdot sin(\omega_ct) = Re[\alpha e^{i\omega_ct} ]

|

:past:`This state can be represented by a sinusoidal analog electronic signal` :math:`\alpha` :past:`. `:math:`a`
:past:`then represents the real part of the sinusoidal signal and` :math:`b` :past:`the imaginary part. The in-phase and
quadrature amplitudes can be obtained by multiplying the state by in-phase and quadrature reference signals and applying
a low-pass filter with a bandpass below` :math:`2\omega_c`:past:`.`

:past:`This can also be extended to model a general single qubit state,` :math:`s(t) = Re[\psi(t)e ]` :past:`.
Let` :math:`\psi(t) = \psi_R(t) + i\psi_I(t) = \alpha_0e^{i \omega t} + \alpha_1e^{-i \omega t}` :past:`, a combination
of the basis states` :math:`|0>` :past:`and` :math:`|1>` :past:`.`

:past:`Then we can redefine` :math:`s(t)` :past:`:`

|

.. math::

    s(t) = \psi_R (t) \cdot cos(\omega_c t) + \psi_I (t) sin(\omega_c t)

|

:past:`This achieves a way by which a general state` :math:`|\psi> = \psi (t) = \alpha` :past:`can be modelled. The real
and imaginary parts of $\psi$ serve as the in-phase and quadrature components of the carrier signal. In-phase and quadrature
references are used in the following configuration, where` :math:`\otimes` :past:`represents a 4 quadrant multiplier. A
4 quadrant multiplier circuit produces the product of its input voltages and either input voltage may be positive or
negative. The` :math:`- \frac{\pi}{2}` :past:`phase shift provides the quadrature reference, and a positive analog filter
is used to finally acquire the state` :math:`s(t)` :past:`.`

  :align: center

|

:past:`Then the analog components required to represent a quantum state are:

- 2 analog sources
- 2 quadrature multiplier circuits
- 1 phase shift circuit
- 1 bandpass filter`

:past:`Similarly, n qubits with n complex coefficients can be expressed in general using the formula:`

|

.. math::

    \psi(t) = \sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1} a_x \phi_x (t)

|


:past:`To represent such a state,` :math:`n + 1` :past:`frequencies are required; one frequency for each qubit as well
as the carrier frequency` :math:`w_c` :past:`. Such an ensemble of states can be created using an octave spacing scheme,
with` :math:`n` :past:`frequencies for the qubits, 2 frequencies for the basis states, and one for the carrier.`

:past:`Since a quantum state of $n$ qubits is represented using a complex oscillating time-domain signal, the number of qubits
that can be encoded is limited by the attainable bandwidth. Another limitation to consider is the requirements for physical
components. The proposed device consists of only three types of electrical components: 4 quadrant multipliers, operational
amplifiers and analog filters. A gate uses a fixed number of multipliers, adders and inverters per qubit. La Cour and Ott claim that the total
number of components needed for the implementation of a gate scales quadratically with the number of qubits the gate
operates on. La Cour and Ott estimate that in order to achieve a density of electrical circuitry footprint
that scales exponentially with the number of qubits, transistor density would need to improve by
a factor of 1000 from what it is today. If this goal were reached, and encoding information with a 1 THz
bandwidth were possible, they claim it would then be feasible to emulate a system of 40 qubits, which is comparable to a
modern high performance computer with 1 TB of RAM.`

:past:`Due to the bandwidth limitation, the inefficiencies of this implementation largely exist in the time domain. The time
dependence of a state introduces a relationship between the signal duration` :math:`T` :past:`and number of modellable qubits` :math:`n` :past:`.
A signal duration of 10 hours would yield roughly 50 qubits, while 1 year would yield roughly 60 qubits. Even if` :math:`T` :past:`were
on the order of the age of the Universe only about 95 qubits could be represented.

La Cour and Ott conclude that a quantum emulation device with an octave spacing of qubit frequencies would be constrained
by an exponential scaling of required bandwidth. So, this signal based emulation methodology also scales with untenable complexity.`
